**Challenge Overview:**

In this challenge, the flag is hidden within the CSS file using obfuscated Unicode fragments. The HTML page displays several boxes whose `::after` pseudo-elements contain parts of the flag encoded as Unicode escape sequences. The flag must be assembled by ordering these fragments correctly. The JavaScript in the HTML file takes the content from the boxes, concatenates them, and then slices the first 28 characters to reveal the flag. The flag is then validated by comparing its SHA-256 hash with the known hash.

**Files Provided:**
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`

**Flag Format:**

The flag follows the format:  
```
DDC{...}
```  
After analysis, the correct flag was found to be:  
```
DDC{C55_15_H4RD_M4N_5K181D1}
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Examine the HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML contains several `<div>` elements with classes like `.box-1`, `.box-2`, etc.
   - The flag is built from the content of these boxes using their `::after` pseudo-elements.
   - A hidden `<div class="result-box" data-flag="">` displays the flag once the correct order is achieved.

2. **Decode the CSS Fragments:**
   - In `styles.css`, each `.box` class (e.g., `.box-4::after`, `.box-9::after`, etc.) uses Unicode escape sequences to hide flag fragments.
   - For example, `.box-4::after { content: "\0044\0044\0043"; }` decodes to `"DDC"`.
   - All fragments are decoded as follows:
     - **box-4:** `"DDC"`
     - **box-9:** `"{C5"`
     - **box-6:** `"5_1"`
     - **box-2:** `"5_H"`
     - **box-10:** `"4RD"`
     - **box-7:** `"_M4"`
     - **box-5:** `"N_5"`
     - **box-1:** `"K18"`
     - **box-8:** `"1D1"`
     - **box-3:** `"}  "` (with extra spaces, trimmed to `"}"`)
     - *(Other boxes were present, but the correct ordering that forms the flag uses the ones above.)*

3. **Assemble the Flag:**
   - Observing the typical CTF flag format and hints from the challenge, the correct order is determined to be:
     1. **Start:** `"DDC"` (from `box-4` indicates the flag format starts with `DDC{...}`)
     2. **Flag Body:** The fragments (when arranged properly) form the content inside the braces:
        - `{C5` (from `box-9`)
        - `5_1` (from `box-6`)
        - `5_H` (from `box-2`)
        - `4RD` (from `box-10`)
        - `_M4` (from `box-7`)
        - `N_5` (from `box-5`)
        - `K18` (from `box-1`)
        - `1D1` (from `box-8`)
     3. **End:** `"}"` (from `box-3`, trimmed)
   - Concatenating these gives:
     ```
     DDC{C55_15_H4RD_M4N_5K181D1}
     ```

4. **Verify the Flag:**
   - The provided JavaScript computes the SHA-256 hash of the first 28 characters of the concatenated string.
   - The expected SHA-256 hash is:  
     `2643e1d88572f77df01a77da0c3752c1f173b4618ab443db60660fac4a05b023`
   - When computing the hash of `DDC{C55_15_H4RD_M4N_5K181D1}`, it matches the expected hash, confirming the correct flag.

## Final Answer

The correct flag for the challenge is:

```
DDC{C55_15_H4RD_M4N_5K181D1}
```

Anyone copying and pasting the above writeup should be able to follow these exact steps and arrive at the correct flag without any further modifications.

Happy CTFing!
