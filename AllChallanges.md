### **Straba**

> Note: The challenge solution does not involve finding any people/locations from the visuals of the picture. You can treat all the pictures as if they are all ai generated. (A few pictures turned out to be real, this is not part of the solution. The author has been bonked with a stick for their crimes.)
> 

We are looking for location of some soldiers. We have received a tip-off that they use Straba to post their runs. However, Straba has a policy of not disclosing any information, so we have to see if we can find something ourselves. Go to straba.hkn and see if you can find anything in the images.

The flag is the name of the city near the military base they are at.

Example flag: **DDC{roskilde}**

### **Efterforskningen**

PET, in collaboration with the NSA, has conducted a long-term investigation into the world-renowned hacker Fin B. Last Friday, PET raided Fin B's residence, where they found a computer. However, when they opened it, they found nothing. They suspect that Fin B deleted all his files before their arrival.

PET now needs your help! They want you to search the most important parts of his computer, such as root. So, bring out your best tools and see if you can recover the deleted documents.

### **ping-sweep**

We suspect that some of our engineers are hiding a secret message in our vulnerability scanner, which uses an ICMP ping sweep at the start of the scan.

We have attached a **.pcap** file that captures an example of suspicious activity. Can you determine if there is anything unique about some of the packets and whether they contain a hidden message?

### **covertchannel1**

A noise covert channel should be in these pcaps. The whole flag has been transmitted in each pcap.

> Hint: Covert channels are information hidden in unusual places. This can for example be in unused fields, how/when packets are sent, or by manipulating fields to carry information. Look for patterns across packets!

## Cryptography/

### **Vigenère's dictionary**

A more advanced substitution cipher is the Vigenère cipher, where a longer key is used to prevent brute-force attacks.

The key was chosen from a Danish dictionary, making it easy to remember.

The encrypted flag is in Danish—can it be decrypted even though it is very short?

Remember to format the result as a flag. (DDC example flag -> **DDC{example_flag}**)

### **Long live, Caesar!**

One of the oldest forms of encryption is the Caesar cipher, where each letter is shifted by a secret key.

This time, someone has modified the Caesar cipher by using multiplication instead of addition.

Can you decrypt the flag?

### **RSA2**

I overslept and missed the lecture on RSA, but gave it a try anyway!

Update 23/02: A player made us aware that the original output.txt wasn't an exact output of the chal.py provided. After investigation it seems that during some parameter changes during testing, the original output was messed it up slightly. We have double checked that our solution still works on it despite this.

For completeness, we've made a new handout where output.txt was generated by the exact script in the handout. We are keeping the old handout for transparency. Again, our solution works on both.

Note: The new handout has a different flag to the original handout. Both flags are accepted by ctfd, so you can solve using either handout :)

### **dlog 2**

A good CTF player knows when you can cheese with compute and when you cant!

> Note: This challenge is solveable on standard consumer hardware! If you have a solution that is barely missing the timeout (on a normal laptop/pc) then open a ticket!

[dlog2.hkn:9999](https://ctf.cyberlandslaget.no/challenges#)

Update: 27/02 We've received a few questions about the compute required for this challenge, so here's a vps benchmark in the hopes of providing clarity.

On a cheap Digital Ocean droplet, (premium intel cpu-optimised (4vcpu),) the reference solve script was able to get the flag locally within the challenge timeout after a few attempts.

The challenge has multiple solves, but we are still willing to support people having issues specifically due to slow personal hardware. If you have a working local solution that gets flag, but misses the timeout by a bit due to slow hardware, open a ticket and we'll see if we can help. (Alternatively, knowing how to rent a cheap online server for computation/ping advantages can be a good skill for a ctf'er to learn ^^)

### **Authenticated Privilige 2, symmetric psyducks return!**

In 2022 we made a nice beginner GCM challenge, but reading writeups like:

Please only submit a payload when you have a working local exploit. You should only install EzAdmin in a virtual machine, running the same version of Windows 11 with secure boot disabled. You get to submit an executable that can run standalone and get a screenshot afterwards. You have an execution limit of 1-2 minutes. If your payload doesn't work, it might have been caught by defender.

### **The Professor's Lost Note**

**Scenario:** A cybersecurity professor at the university, Dr. Niels Andersen, has been working on a set of notes containing tips and solutions for the upcoming exams. Unfortunately, Dr. Andersen misplaced one of these files, **hint.txt**, while organizing his folders, and now he needs your help to retrieve it before it's too late!

You have been given a folder named **Professor_Notes**, which contains multiple files. Somewhere in this folder, there is a hidden file containing Dr. Andersen’s important note. However, it seems like the file is not directly visible in the folder.

**Tip:** The note you are looking for may not be immediately obvious. By using the right terminal commands to explore directories and inspect files and their contents, you will be able to find the lost information.

**Tips:**

Some important concepts you might want to consider include hidden files, encoding (base64), and using **exiftool** to analyze image metadata.

### **Hasher is back**

💀 We hashed the flag, can you crack it?💀

MD5 Hash: 24bb5c555b8f32d27eaeec9c5522b576

🛠️ find the value we hashed and insert it into the flag format like so: DDC{cracked-hash-words-here} . 🛠️

```
Pro tip: Its **not** possible to reverse a hash directly to go **from** the hash value back to its "pre-image". However **if** you have some guesses **for** what the the original message could be, you can test them to see **if** they match **in** a so-called "dictionary attack"! Tools like john the ripper **or** hashcat can **do** **this** very fast, **or** you can **try** googling to find databases of pre-computed hashes to look the hash up **in**.
